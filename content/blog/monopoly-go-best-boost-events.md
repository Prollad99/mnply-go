Monopoly Go offers a range of special events designed to help players maximize their rewards, from collecting free dice to earning bonus cash and rare stickers. To help you navigate the many events, we’ve compiled a list of the best boost events that can skyrocket your earnings and improve your gameplay strategy.

## 1. **Golden Blitz**

The Golden Blitz event is a fan favorite, as it allows players to trade rare gold stickers. These stickers are typically untradeable, so this event presents a unique opportunity to complete sticker sets, often leading to additional dice rolls or other rewards. Trading up to five stickers per day helps players engage with the community while progressing faster. This is a must-participate event for sticker collectors and those looking for extra bonuses.

## 2. **Cash Boost**

Cash Boost doubles the cash you earn from all regular gameplay activities, such as rolling dice and completing boards. This boost is invaluable when you're trying to upgrade landmarks or participate in other high-reward events. Pairing this event with others, such as Rent Frenzy, can lead to significant gains in a short period.

## 3. **Wheel Boost**

Wheel Boost provides an extra spin on the Property Wheel, which is a key source of rewards like dice, cash, and stickers. If you're completing hotel sets, this event offers even more opportunities to collect resources. It’s a great way to accelerate your game progress with minimal effort.

## 4. **Monument Rush**

Monument Rush is another fantastic event that rewards players with extra dice and cash for every landmark they complete. If you’re planning on upgrading several landmarks, this event can significantly boost your earnings. The rewards scale with your level, making it particularly beneficial for high-level players.

## 5. **Sticker Boom**

If you’re focused on building your sticker collection, Sticker Boom is the event to look out for. During this event, the number of stickers you receive from packs increases by 50%. While the quality of the stickers remains unchanged, it’s a great way to collect more stickers and increase your chances of completing sets.

## 6. **Partners Event**

This is one of the largest social events in Monopoly Go, allowing you to team up with friends to build attractions on your board. The more tokens you collect, the more spins you get on the prize wheel, which can unlock significant rewards. It’s also a great opportunity to collaborate with other players and make faster progress.

## 7. **Rent Frenzy**

During Rent Frenzy, you'll encounter more rent targets on the board, leading to increased rent income. This event is a great way to stack cash quickly, especially when combined with Cash Boost or other multiplier events. It’s a straightforward but highly rewarding event that fits well with any strategy.

## 8. **High Roller**

High Roller allows you to dramatically increase your dice multiplier, potentially up to x1000. This event is excellent for players looking to make massive gains in both cash and rewards. While it requires strategic play to get the most out of it, the potential returns make it one of the most exciting events in the game.

## 9. **Milestone Events**

Milestone Events offer unique objectives with high rewards. Completing these objectives unlocks major bonuses, which can include everything from dice to rare stickers. These events vary in format but are always worth participating in for the chance to earn exclusive rewards.

## 10. **Board Rush**

Similar to Monument Rush, Board Rush rewards players for completing entire boards. This event is perfect for players who are already progressing through the game quickly and want to earn extra rewards along the way. With each board you complete, the rewards increase, making this a great event for consistent players.
