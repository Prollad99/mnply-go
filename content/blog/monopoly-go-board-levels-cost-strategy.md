Monopoly Go has over 130 unique boards that players must complete in sequence to progress through the game. Each board offers a different theme and set of landmarks, from iconic cities like **New York** and **London** to fantasy realms like **Gnomeburg** and **Monopolis 3000**. Advancing through these boards requires a strategic approach to managing in-game currency, dice rolls, and upgrades.

## Board Costs Breakdown

The cost to complete a Monopoly Go board increases as you advance. For example, early boards like **New York City** and **London** have much lower costs than later stages like **Monopulon 5** or **Barcelona**, where costs can reach into the billions. Here's a general breakdown of board costs:

- **Early boards** (Levels 1-30) can cost between 10M to 500M.
- **Mid-tier boards** (Levels 30-70) range from 500M to over 1B.
- **Advanced boards** (Levels 70+) can exceed **1.5B**, with some boards like **Barcelona** and **Caesarâ€™s Rome** going as high as **2.5B**.

The exact cost to upgrade each landmark on a board can be calculated by multiplying the cost of the first upgrade by 112. As such, planning ahead for each board is crucial for efficient progress.

## Strategies for Advancing Faster

1. **Save Your Money**: A common mistake is upgrading landmarks as soon as you have enough money. However, veteran players recommend waiting until you can afford to complete the entire board in one go. This prevents your opponents from destroying your landmarks and wasting your hard-earned money.

2. **Take Advantage of Events**: Time your board completions around in-game events like **Landmark Rush** or **Wheel Boost**. These events can provide extra rewards, including bonus dice and sticker packs, which will help you progress faster.

3. **Use Free Dice Wisely**: Dice rolls are the lifeblood of Monopoly Go. Make sure you collect free dice daily to maximize your chances of moving quickly through the boards. Check out [Monopoly GO Free Dice](https://monopolygofreedice.wiki/) for regular updates on free dice links.

4. **Target High-Value Landmarks**: Prioritize upgrading the landmarks that yield the most in-game benefits, such as extra dice rolls or special bonuses. This will give you an edge in future boards, helping you to save more resources in the long run.

## Conclusion

Monopoly Go board levels become increasingly challenging as you progress, but with the right strategies, you can advance efficiently while minimizing wasted resources. By saving your in-game currency, timing your upgrades during events, and utilizing free dice opportunities, you'll conquer the toughest boards like a pro.
