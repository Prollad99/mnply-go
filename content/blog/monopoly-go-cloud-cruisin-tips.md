Monopoly Go’s Cloud Cruisin' event is one of the most rewarding yet challenging features in the game. It offers players a chance to earn a vast amount of rewards, including free dice, stickers, cash, and even exclusive packs. This guide will walk you through the key tasks, tips, and strategies to help you successfully complete the event and maximize your rewards.

## How Does the Cloud Cruisin' Event Work?

In Cloud Cruisin', players must collect special spaceship tokens by landing on designated tiles across the Monopoly Go board. These tokens are essential for accumulating points that unlock milestone rewards as you progress through the event. Notably, the final milestone grants a staggering **6,500 dice rolls**, making it one of the most lucrative events for building up your dice reserves.

### Scoring Points

To gather points efficiently, players need to land on specific **Tax** and **Utility** tiles. Each tile type rewards a different number of points:
- **Tax Tiles (Income and Luxury Tax)**: Earn 3 points
- **Utility Tiles (Electric Company and Water Works)**: Earn 2 points

Using dice multipliers (e.g., x10 or x20) can significantly boost your points in a single roll, but use them wisely.

## Rewards Breakdown

The event offers a total of **49 milestones**, each tied to specific rewards ranging from dice rolls to sticker packs and cash. Here are a few key rewards to look out for:
- **15 Dice Rolls** at 10 points
- **225 Dice Rolls** at 150 points
- **1,000 Dice Rolls** at 1,000 points
- **6,500 Dice Rolls** as the final reward at 6,500 points.

## Tips to Maximize Your Dice and Rewards

To make the most out of Cloud Cruisin', follow these expert tips:

1. **Save Your Highest Dice Multipliers**: Use your biggest multipliers when you're about to land on a points tile. This will drastically increase your tokens and rewards. If you're using smaller rolls, you may miss out on maximizing your progress.

2. **Watch for Tournaments and Other Dice-Generating Events**: Keep an eye on other in-game events, such as tournaments or special landmarks, where you can earn extra dice to help you progress further in Cloud Cruisin'.

3. **Don't Waste Dice**: While it's tempting to spend your dice to advance quickly, consider saving them for more lucrative future events if the current rewards don’t seem worth the effort.

4. **Plan Your Strategy**: If you find yourself struggling to reach a particular milestone, it might be best to pause and strategize rather than using up all your dice on an inefficient roll sequence. Sometimes, waiting for the next event might yield better results.

## Conclusion

Monopoly Go's Cloud Cruisin' event provides players with a fantastic opportunity to rack up free dice rolls and exclusive rewards.
