Monopoly Go, a widely popular digital version of the iconic board game, keeps things exciting with a variety of in-game events. These events offer players numerous opportunities to win dice, stickers, cash, and more. Whether you're a new player or a seasoned pro, understanding how to take advantage of these events will significantly boost your gameplay.

In this guide, we'll break down the different types of Monopoly Go events and offer tips on how to maximize your rewards.

## 1. **Golden Blitz**

The **Golden Blitz** event is a fan favorite that allows players to trade Gold Stickersâ€”rare collectibles that can be exchanged for valuable in-game rewards. Each day, you can trade up to five Gold Stickers during the event. Keep an eye on your sticker collection, and when the Golden Blitz appears, make sure you're ready to make the most of your trades! These events happen frequently, and knowing when the next one is coming up can help you prepare.

### **Tip**: Save your Gold Stickers for Golden Blitz to ensure maximum value from your trades.

## 2. **Tournaments**

Tournaments are competitive events where players race to complete objectives, collecting a special tournament currency. Rewards are tiered based on your leaderboard position, so aim high! The prizes often include dice, in-game cash, and limited-time collectibles. Events such as **Cloud Cruisin'** and **Pod Pursuit** are examples of tournaments that can last a day or more.

### **Tip**: Monitor the leaderboard regularly and use any boosts available during the tournament to stay ahead of the competition.

## 3. **Partners Event**

This is one of the most social events in Monopoly Go, where you team up with friends to build structures and earn rewards. The more progress you make with your partner, the bigger the rewards. Just be careful when choosing your partner, as the partnership is locked in for the duration of the event.

### **Tip**: Pick a partner who is as active as you are in the game to maximize your chances of completing milestones quickly.

## 4. **Board Rush**

During a **Board Rush** event, players earn additional rewards for completing all the landmarks on their current board. This is a great time to make rapid progress, as each completed board can lead to valuable in-game rewards such as dice or multipliers.

### **Tip**: Stockpile dice before a Board Rush to ensure you can complete as many landmarks as possible.

## 5. **Free Parking Dice**

The **Free Parking Dice** event gives players the chance to accumulate free dice every time they land on specific tiles. These dice are stored and rewarded the next time you land on the Free Parking space. With enough dice, this event can help you build momentum and extend your gameplay.

### **Tip**: Aim to land on Free Parking multiple times to build up a stash of free dice.

## 6. **Rent Frenzy**

The **Rent Frenzy** event increases the number of rent-earning tiles on your board, making it easier to collect rent faster. More rent means more cash, which can be reinvested into upgrading landmarks and boosting your overall progress.

### **Tip**: Focus on landing on rent tiles during this event to maximize your cash income.

## 7. **Landmark Rush**

Similar to Board Rush, **Landmark Rush** focuses on upgrading your landmarks. Every time you finish upgrading a landmark during this event, you're rewarded with bonuses. It's an excellent opportunity to speed up your city-building progress.

### **Tip**: Use any available dice multipliers during Landmark Rush to upgrade landmarks faster.

## 8. **Cash Grab**

In this quick mini-game event, players can collect cash by tapping the floating notes that appear on the screen. This event can be triggered when landing on specific tiles, offering a fun way to increase your cash earnings.

### **Tip**: Be quick on your taps to grab as much cash as possible during this mini-game.

## 9. **Sticker Boom**

During the **Sticker Boom** event, you'll receive additional stickers each time you earn a sticker pack. If you're aiming to complete a sticker album, this event can help you do it faster.

### **Tip**: Focus on completing tasks that give sticker packs to maximize your sticker collection during this event.

## 10. **Milestone Events**

Milestone events offer players the chance to complete unique objectives in exchange for significant rewards. These events can last for several days and often provide the biggest prizes in the game.

### **Tip**: Plan your gameplay around these milestone events to ensure you're completing tasks efficiently.
