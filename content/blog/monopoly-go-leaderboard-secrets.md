Climbing the **Monopoly Go** leaderboard is all about strategic gameplay, efficient resource management, and making the most of every tournament. Here's how you can stay ahead of the competition and secure top spots consistently.

## 1. Master the Power of Dice Multipliers

One of the most critical factors in climbing the leaderboard is effectively using **dice multipliers**. Every time you roll the dice in a tournament, you can use a multiplier to boost your score. This means that rather than earning just 10 points from a roll, applying a 5x multiplier would give you 50 points. The key is to save your multipliers for high-value actions like **Bank Heists** and **Shutdowns**.

- **Pro Tip**: Use your highest multipliers when you’re about to land on a big bonus like a **Mega Bank Heist** to maximize your points.

## 2. Focus on High-Point Actions

Tournaments revolve around specific tasks, and not all actions are created equal. **Bank Heists**, particularly the larger ones, provide some of the highest points in the game. Similarly, **Shutdowns** are another great opportunity to boost your score.

- **Bank Heists**: Large heists can give up to 24 points per action, while smaller ones offer 12 or 16 points depending on their scale. If you use a multiplier, these points can skyrocket.
- **Shutdowns**: Even unsuccessful shutdowns will give you 2 points, while successful ones can add up to 4. These may not seem like much, but with consistent play and multiplier use, they add up fast.

## 3. Timing is Everything

Joining a tournament early and staying active can give you a significant edge. The more rolls you have saved up, the better your chances of securing a top position. Plan your dice spending carefully, aiming to participate heavily during tournament hours to rack up as many points as possible.

- **Save Dice Rolls**: Before a big tournament, refrain from using your dice rolls unnecessarily. Focus on collecting as many free dice as you can by checking out **[Monopoly GO Free Dice](https://monopolygofreedice.wiki/)** regularly for daily links.
  
## 4. Participate in Every Tournament

Consistency is crucial when it comes to leaderboard success. Each tournament might have slightly different rules or point systems, but by participating regularly, you’ll develop a feel for how to maximize your performance across different events.

- **Adaptability**: The top players often change their strategies based on the specific rules of each tournament, so don’t be afraid to adjust your playstyle.

## 5. Watch the Leaderboard

Keeping an eye on your competitors is another important strategy. If you're closing in on a high-ranking player, it may be worth using some of your saved dice rolls to push ahead of them before the tournament ends. Timing your final push for the top spot is critical, especially as many players surge in the final minutes.

## Conclusion

With the right strategies in place, securing a top position in **Monopoly Go** tournaments is achievable. Use your dice wisely, focus on high-point actions, and keep a close eye on the leaderboard. And, of course, don’t forget to collect your daily free dice to maximize your chances of success!
