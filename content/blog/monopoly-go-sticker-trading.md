Sticker collecting in *Monopoly Go* offers players a unique way to enhance their game, unlocking rewards, free dice, and special prizes. By understanding the mechanics of sticker packs and trading, you can significantly improve your game experience. Here’s a detailed guide on how to trade stickers effectively and maximize your rewards.

## 1. **Sticker Packs Overview**

In *Monopoly Go*, stickers come in different star levels and can be obtained from various packs such as Green, Pink, Blue, and Purple Packs. Each pack has a specific star rating, ranging from common 1-star stickers to rare 5-star ones. The higher the star value of the pack, the better your chances of getting a rare sticker. For example, Purple Packs guarantee a 5-star sticker, while Green Packs offer common 1-star stickers.

To accelerate your collection, aim for **event milestones** and **tournament victories**, which often reward high-value packs like the **Purple Pack**. Completing specific board achievements can also yield valuable sticker packs, including Galaxy Packs, which can help you obtain any missing sticker.

## 2. **Trading Stickers**

Trading duplicates with friends is one of the fastest ways to complete your sticker album. However, there are a few limitations:

- **Duplicates Required**: You can only trade stickers that you already have duplicates of.
- **Trade Limit**: You can send up to 5 stickers per day to your friends.
- **Friends List**: To trade, both players must be connected on Facebook and have each other added as friends.

This system makes trading a strategic part of the game, allowing you to share your surplus with others while benefiting from their extras.

## 3. **Maximizing Your Sticker Rewards**

Here are some tips to maximize the rewards from your stickers:

- **Save for Sticker Boom**: After *Golden Blitz* events, the game often introduces a **Sticker Boom** boost, where the sticker packs you collect are 50% larger for one hour. Save your dice and sticker packs to open during this time.
  
- **Use Stars for Galaxy Packs**: Accumulate stars from duplicate stickers to unlock Galaxy Packs. These special packs can contain missing stickers from your collection, regardless of their star rating. It’s best to save these packs for the later stages of your sticker album.

- **Participate in Special Events**: Keep an eye on limited-time events that offer exclusive sticker packs. Finishing high in tournaments or completing board rushes during these events will grant you access to rare stickers.

## 4. **Collecting and Trading Etiquette**

If you’re trading with friends, it’s essential to maintain fair exchanges. Don’t hoard high-value stickers; help your friends complete their albums as well. The more active your trading network, the faster you’ll progress through the game.
