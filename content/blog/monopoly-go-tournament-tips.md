Monopoly Go tournaments offer exciting opportunities to compete against other players, rack up points, and earn valuable rewards like free dice, stickers, and game currency. But to truly excel, you need a well-honed strategy. This guide will help you make the most of your dice rolls, optimize your multipliers, and climb the leaderboard for maximum rewards.

## What Are Monopoly Go Tournaments?

Tournaments are time-limited competitive events where players aim to gather as many points as possible to rank on the leaderboard. Your position at the end of the event determines the types of rewards you receive. Rewards can include **free dice rolls**, **sticker packs**, **in-game currency**, and **special event items** like Peg-E Tokens. Keep in mind that tournament formats may vary, so always check the event rules by tapping the tournament icon on your game screen.

## Essential Tips to Win Monopoly Go Tournaments

### 1. **Collect More Dice Rolls**
The more dice you roll, the more points you accumulate. Before joining a tournament, ensure you’ve collected as many free dice as possible. You can claim free dice by visiting [Monopoly GO Free Dice](https://monopolygofreedice.wiki/) daily and by participating in other events and milestones within the game.

### 2. **Use Dice Multipliers Strategically**
One of the quickest ways to gain points in tournaments is by leveraging your dice multipliers. By using a higher multiplier, each roll contributes significantly more to your score. However, be mindful of when to use it — it’s best deployed during key stages of the tournament when you have a surplus of dice rolls to avoid running out too early.

### 3. **Join Late to Maximize Your Chance of Success**
Some players have found success by joining tournaments later in the event window. Joining later can reduce competition, as fewer high-ranking players may be actively rolling dice, giving you a better chance to rise up the leaderboard.

### 4. **Prioritize High-Point Tiles**
Focus on landing on high-reward tiles such as **Railroads**, **Chance Cards**, and **Rent Properties** to maximize your points per roll. Utilizing multipliers on these tiles will give you a massive boost in your score.

### 5. **Take Advantage of Special Events**
During tournaments, other in-game events like **Bank Heists** and **Shutdowns** can provide additional point boosts. Coordinate with friends in-game to perform shutdowns and bank heists, which can give you extra dice and points during the tournament.

## Earning Tournament Rewards

Monopoly Go tournaments have **milestones** that offer rewards as you progress. These can include free dice, stickers, and in-game cash. As you hit these milestones, you’ll automatically receive the rewards, but your ultimate goal should be to place as high as possible on the leaderboard. The higher your rank, the better the rewards.

Once the tournament ends, close the app and reopen it to claim your final leaderboard rewards. This trick ensures that the game recalculates your position and grants your well-earned prizes.

## Final Thoughts

Winning Monopoly Go tournaments requires a mix of strategy, luck, and careful planning. Collect as many dice as possible, use your multipliers wisely, and aim to hit those high-value tiles. By following these tips, you'll not only boost your leaderboard ranking but also unlock valuable rewards that will help you progress faster in the game.
