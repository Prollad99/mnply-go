Monopoly Go is a social mobile game that combines the classic board game experience with exciting, team-based events. Among these, the **Partner Events** are fan favorites, offering players a chance to team up, achieve milestones, and win exclusive rewards. In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about these upcoming events, including how to join, what rewards you can expect, and tips for maximizing your chances of success.

## What Are Partner Events?

**Partner Events** in Monopoly Go allow players to team up with friends or other participants to complete event-specific objectives. These events occur periodically and require coordination to achieve the best results. You and your team will need to collect tokens, complete challenges, and build structures on the board. Your goal is to maximize points and hit milestones, which unlock valuable rewards, such as dice rolls, stickers, and in-game currency.

During a Partner Event, you can form a group of up to four players. The team works together to gather points, which contribute to building and upgrading attractions on the game board. As your team’s score increases, so do the rewards.

## Upcoming Partner Events in 2024

Partner Events are not daily occurrences but come around at specific times throughout the year. Based on the latest event calendars, we can anticipate several exciting Partner Events in the coming months:

- **Ice Cream Partners** (July 10 - July 15, 2024): This event lets you collaborate with your team to earn points by spinning the event wheel, using ice-cream-themed tokens. You can expect rewards such as free dice rolls, exclusive stickers, and tokens to build your board.
  
- **Robo Partners** (May 16 - May 21, 2024): This event had futuristic themes with the Robo Penguin Token as the top reward, along with up to 5,000 dice rolls.

- **Golden Blitz Event**: While this is primarily a solo event, it sometimes overlaps with Partner Events, offering additional ways to earn five-star stickers, which you can trade with teammates.

## How to Participate in a Partner Event

To join a Partner Event, you must first reach the **5th board** in the game. This unlocks eligibility for Partner Events. Once an event is live, you will be prompted to select or invite partners. Be strategic with your selection, as you cannot change partners mid-event.

Once the event starts, each player on the team contributes to the same progress bar. Complete tasks such as landing on specific tiles or collecting event tokens to earn points. These tokens are crucial for spinning the event wheel, which grants further rewards like dice, money, or special tokens to upgrade attractions.

## Tips to Maximize Your Rewards

1. **Coordinate with Your Team**: Make sure all team members are actively participating. Communication is key to ensure everyone is contributing tokens and completing tasks.
2. **Use Your Tokens Wisely**: Save up event-specific tokens and use them strategically to maximize your spins and reward potential.
3. **Hit Milestones Early**: The sooner your team hits event milestones, the better. Early progress ensures you’ll have more time to reach higher levels and claim top-tier rewards.

## Conclusion

The Monopoly Go Partner Events are an exciting opportunity for teamwork, strategy, and exclusive rewards. Whether you're working with friends or using in-game partner suggestions, these events provide a refreshing break from solo play. Stay updated on upcoming events and make sure you’re ready to take advantage of the rewards they offer.
